# image steganalysis project
A crucial area of digital forensics called Image steganalysis seeks to identify the existence of steganographically concealed information in digital images. The problem is that the trend of using digital images as a means of exchanging hidden information is rising so this study proposes a machine learning-based model for image steganalysis. The significance of this study is to create an effective model for image steganalysis with a good accuracy. The aim of the project is to develop an image steganalysis model for detecting hidden information in digital images, and objective of the  project is to design a machine learning based image steganalysis model, implement the designed model, and evaluate the performance of the model. The methodology used was a hybrid model that combined the best of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random forest classifier for feature extraction and classification respectively. The hybrid model’s performance was evaluated and visualized using the test set from the dataset to obtain different performance for each algorithm including: Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, ROC curve, and ROC-AUC. It was found that the hybrid model obtained 75% accuracy, 79% in precision, 91% in recall, 0.67 score in the AUC and 0.8400 for f1-score. The study intends to shed light on the efficacy and constraints of machine learning in detecting steganographic content, as well as its possible use in practical settings for digital image forensics.
